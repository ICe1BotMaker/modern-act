# Modern Act

- Originally, **Kithub** was intended to be developed based on **React**, ~~but the developer's greed also led to a new one called **Modern Act**.~~

- **Modern Act** begins with a new file extension called `.act`. This extension **.act** was conceived by the developer himself and will be used in future development of the markup language.

- The portfolio will be updated continuously.

### Differences from React

- **React** speeds up by reloading components when state changes, while **Modern Act** speeds up by reloading text when state.

- While **React** is entirely JavaScript, **Modern Act** uses a markup language created by developers.
